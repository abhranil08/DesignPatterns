Proxy pattern is used when we need to create a wrapper to cover the main objectâ€™s complexity from the client.

Advantages:
One of the advantages of Proxy pattern is security.
This pattern avoids duplication of objects which might be huge size and memory intensive. This in turn increases the performance of the application.
The remote proxy also ensures about security by installing the local code proxy (stub) in the client machine and then accessing the server with help of the remote code.

Disadvantages
This pattern introduces another layer of abstraction which sometimes may be an issue if the RealSubject code is accessed by some of the clients directly and some of them might access the Proxy classes. This might cause disparate behaviour.

classes :

subject - interface which expose the functionalities available to be used by the clients
real subject - class implementing subject -> hidden behing proxy
proxy - hides real object, usually frameworks creates proxies when client request for object
